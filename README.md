ScriptEd carnival assignment
----------------------------

This project reviews types in Javascript, forms, and jQuery events.

- An amusement park near you needs help figuring out who's old enough to enter the ride, and they've asked you to build a web page to help them out.
- This is similar to the web page they want you to build: https://thimbleprojects.org/vaibhav2614/119863/
- When you're ready to work on the project, start by logging into Github and forking this repository: https://github.com/v/carnival_assignment
- Then, create a project in cloud9 by cloning from your repository's URL.
- Work on the project in cloud 9 until you have completed the assignment.
- When you're finished with the project, push it to github like so
    * `git add .`
    * `git commit -m "<your message goes here>"`
    * `git push`
- Submit the link to your repository as "Carnival Assignment".

Extra Credit: Carnival Assignment 2.0
- The carnival has decided that children accompanied by adults can go on any ride.
- In addition to asking a person for their age, they want you to ask them if they're being accompanied by an adult. If they're being accompanied by an adult they should be allowed to go on rides, regardless of how old they are.
- When you're done, push your changes to github (see instructions above)
- Submit the link to your repository as "Carnival Assignment 2.0"
